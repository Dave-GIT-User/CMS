<p><span>CMS Prime&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is a final project for BYU Idaho class WDD 430, Web Full-Stack Development, Winter 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>CMS appears to have been around as a teaching tool since about 2010. This version is a final project that tries to make some of the scaffolding more usable. For instance, deployment, login, and a security model were all out of scope. As part of that, documents are now assigned authors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The "admin" is David Hendricks, the only contact right now with real information. If any of the historical contacts wish to reach him, he will respond to any email requests. For now, other contact information has been made anonymous to reduce the chance that they will be spammed or targeted in some way.</span></p>
<p><span>Attempts were made to assign the right author to each document, but the admin will respond to any information in this regard. Such assignments were made arbitrarily, lacking such knowledge. If any of the original contacts wishes, the admin can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Delete their contacts, messages, and documents</span></li>
<li><span>Allow them to reset their passwords and they can do what they wish with their contacts, messages, and documents.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For other users, any feedback from beta testing is greatly appreciated, either via messages in the appliciation or emailing the admin. Attempts are also underway to update links. Please email the admin or post a message in the application if a bad link is found. Highest priority will be assigned to information from the original contacts.</span></p>
