        <p>It was decided to implement a basic login without calling a framework 
            or API. The logic is that a username and password are concatenated and 
            then passed to a hash function. That hash is then stored in the contacts 
            collection along with the user's other information. 
        </p>
    </span>

<h4>
    <span>
        <p>The user name and password
            each allow spaces but are trimmed of white space at each end. 
            The current rule is that there must be upper and lower case letters
            in the password, but this could easily be modified for complexity. 
            Passwords must be between 8 and 20 characters.

    <span>
        <p>When someone attempts to log in, the hash is once again generated. If 
            that hash matches that of a contact, they are logged in. This event 
            including admin status is cached to local storage, saving the user from 
            repeatedly logging in after the application loses its state.
        </p>
    </span>
</h4>
<h4>
    <span>
        <p>When they log out, they become anonymous users with read-only rights 
            and the cached login and admin status is purged from cache. 
            Nothing prevents a user from walking away without logging out. 
            However, if they attempt to reuse that cached login the next day, 
            they are logged out and the expired details are dropped from local storage.
        </p>

    <span>
        <p>As a further security step, new accounts must have unique user names 
            and produce unique hashes. The hash routine, while it has a space of 
            billions of values, could conceivably produce the same hash for different 
            username/password inputs. This would allow one user to access another user's 
            data with elevated rights. The error message only suggests they try a 
            different username/password pair, without telling them whether the name 
            or the hash was the issue.
