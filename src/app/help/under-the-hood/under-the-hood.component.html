        <p>The documents container in MongoDB has an array of children, each 
            element of which is a document in its own right. However, 
            further nesting such as working with grandchildren is not currently handled.

    <span>
        <p>This document is an example of a parent document containing child 
            documents. You can click any of the child documents to get a title 
            and optional description, and click view to see each one. Only the 
            author can edit such a document or subdocument, and only the author 
            or the administrator can delete it.
        </p>
