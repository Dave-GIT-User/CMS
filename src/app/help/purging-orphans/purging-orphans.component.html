    <p>The MongoDB database for this implementation of CMS has foreign key 
        contraints, that all documents must have authors and all messages 
        must have senders. These are each in the contacts collection. The 
        dilemma is what to do if a contact is deleted after that person 
        created documents and sent messages.
    </p>
    <p> A former client-side remedy no longer works, once we migrated
        from FireBase to MongoDB. The approach taken here is that when 
        a contact is deleted, the API first gets rid of any documents 
        and messages from that person. Otherwise, the data is broken 
        such that get operations fail with a 500 error.

    <hr>The delete contact method:
    <pre>
        router.delete("/:id", async (req, res, next) => %7B
            try %7B
                const contactId = req.params.id;
                await util.purgeOphanedRecords(contactId);
                const contact = await Contact.findOne(%7B id: req.params.id %7D)       
                    contact.deleteOne(%7B id: contactId %7D)
                    .then(result => %7B
                        res.status(204).json(%7B
                        message: "Contact deleted successfully"
                        %7D);
                    %7D)      
            %7D catch(error) %7B
                res.status(500).json(%7B
                message: 'An error occurred',
                error: error
                %7D);
            %7D
        %7D);
    </pre>
    <hr>The purge orphans method:
    <pre>
        // Messages and documents each have foreign keys to contacts.
        // If a contact is deleted, first their documents and 
        // messages must be purged.
        async purgeOphanedRecords(id) %7B
            try %7B
                // const author = await Contact.findOne(
                const contact_id = await this.getContact_id(id);
                await Document.deleteMany(%7Bauthor: contact_id%7D)
                await Message.deleteMany(%7Bsender: contact_id%7D)
            %7D catch (err) %7B
                console.log('Error purging orphaned records');
                throw err;
            %7D
        %7D
    </pre>
